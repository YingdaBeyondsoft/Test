# Required diagnostic data for Office

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article applies to Version 1904 or later of the following Office client software installed on a computer running Windows:
> - Office 365 ProPlus and Office 365 Business
> - Office 365 Personal, Office 365 Home, or other versions of Office that are part of an Office 365 subscription.
> - Project and Visio that come with some subscription plans, such as the Project Online Professional plan or Visio Online Plan 2.

Diagnostic data is used to keep Office secure and up-to-date, detect, diagnose and fix problems, and also make product improvements. This data does not include a user’s name or email address, the content of the user’s files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.

This diagnostic data is collected and sent to Microsoft about Office client software being used on computers running Windows. Some diagnostic data is required, while some diagnostic data is optional. We give you the ability to choose whether to send us required or optional diagnostic data through the use of privacy controls, such as policy settings for organizations. You can see the diagnostic data being sent to us by using the Diagnostic Data Viewer.

***Required diagnostic data*** is the minimum data necessary to help keep Office secure, up-to-date, and performing as expected on the device it’s installed on.

Required diagnostic data helps to identify problems with Office that may be related to a device or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if an Office feature crashes more frequently on a particular operating system version, with newly introduced features, or when certain Office features are disabled. Required diagnostic data helps us detect, diagnose, and fix these problems more quickly so the impact to users or organizations is reduced.

For more information about diagnostic data, see the following:

## Categories, data subtypes, events, and data fields for required diagnostic data

Required diagnostic data is organized into categories and data subtypes. Within each data subtype are events, which contain data fields that are specific to that event.

The following table provides a list of the categories for required diagnostic data. The data subtypes within each category are listed, along with a description of the focus for that data subtype. There are links to each data subtype section where you’ll find the following information:

- A list of events in that data subtype

> [!NOTE]
> - Categories are shown in the Diagnostic Data Viewer, but data subtypes are not shown.
> - A data field marked *Obsolete* has been or will soon be removed from required diagnostic data. Some of these data fields are duplicates that arose as diagnostic data was modernized and were used to ensure no service disruption to live diagnostic monitoring reports.

## Categories and data fields that are common for all events

There is some information about events that is common to all events, regardless of category or data subtype. This common information, which is sometimes referred to as *data contracts*, is organized into categories. Each category contains fields, and these fields are the metadata and properties of an individual event. You can view this information by using the Diagnostic Data Viewer.

The categories of information that is collected about events can be divided into two groups:

Used to fix common registration issues where add-ins are not installed properly and never show up resulting in them being unusable.

The following fields are collected:

  - None

#### Office.Extensibility.Catalog.ExchangeGetEntitlements

#### Office.Extensibility.Catalog.ExchangeGetLastUpdate

Data regarding the success for failure of retrieving the need for updated data regarding the Office 365 tenant admin assigned add-ins. Used for health metrics, charts, and analysis of customer problems. ExchangeGetLastUpdate will always run on boot as part of the host code and determine whether add-in assignments have changed for a user.  If so then osf.DLL will be loaded so we can call ExchangeGetEntitlements to get the specific assignments (and ExchangeGetManifests will called to retrieve any new manifest that are needed).  ExchangeGetEntitlements (and ExchangeGetManifests) could also be called on demand after host application has been running.  The idea is to not load the large DLL if we don’t need to.  Without this event in Required, we would not be able to tell if users are failing to get add-ins assigned to them if that first service call fails.  It’s also the main signal for any auth problems we face talking to our service.

The following fields are collected:

  - **Abort -** whether the host was shut down during the service call

  - **AllowPrompt -** whether auth prompting was allowed

  - **AuthScheme -** the auth scheme requested by exchange
