# Optional diagnostic data for Office

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article applies to Version 1904 or later of the following Office client software installed on a computer running Windows:
> - Office 365 ProPlus and Office 365 Business
> - Office 365 Personal, Office 365 Home, or other versions of Office that are part of an Office 365 subscription.
> - Project and Visio that come with some subscription plans, such as the Project Online Professional plan or Visio Online Plan 2.

Diagnostic data is used to keep Office secure and up-to-date, detect, diagnose and fix problems, and also make product improvements. This data does not include a user’s name or email address, the content of the user’s files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.

This diagnostic data is collected and sent to Microsoft about Office client software being used on computers running Windows. Some diagnostic data is required, while some diagnostic data is optional. We give you the ability to choose whether to send us required or optional diagnostic data through the use of privacy controls, such as policy settings for organizations. You can see the diagnostic data being sent to us by using the Diagnostic Data Viewer.

***Optional diagnostic data*** is additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and fix issues.

If you choose to send us optional diagnostic data, required diagnostic data is also included.

Examples of optional diagnostic data include data we collect about the shapes users insert into Word documents so we can provide better options, and data we collect about the time it takes for a PowerPoint slide to appear on your screen so we can improve the experience if it’s slow.

For more information about diagnostic data, see the following:
